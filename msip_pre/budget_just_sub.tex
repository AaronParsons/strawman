Composite Fringe benefits are:
\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{| l | l | l | l | l | l |}
\hline
            ~ & FY15    & FY16    & FY17   & FY18   & FY19 \\ \hline \hline
Undergrad/GSR &	0\%     & 0\%     & 0\%    & 0\%    &  0\% \\ \hline
Staff         & 44.6\%  & 47.6\%  & 50.5\% & 51.3\% &  51.3\% \\ \hline
Academic      & 36.8\%  & 39.5\%  & 42.1\% & 42.6\% &   42.6\% \\ \hline
\hline
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:fringeBenefits}
\end{table}

Rates beyond June 30, 2014, are estimates and are provided for planning purposes only. Future benefits rates are subject to review and approval by the Department of Health and Human Services on an annual or bi-annual basis. Therefore, regardless of which rates are used to estimate the cost of fringe benefits at the proposal stage, the fringe benefit costs ultimately charged to the sponsored project will always be based on the DHHS-approved fringe rates in existence at that time.

The Graduate Student Researchers will receive remissions of Fees, Health Insurance and Non-California Resident Tuition per semester at a rate of \$15,141 per semester in year one.  A 10\% per year escalation in fees are calculated.  Graduate Student fee remission, health insurance and non-California resident tuition remissions are not included in the Indirect Costs calculation. 

{\bf Equipment:}  As the managing institution, Berkeley will procure most of the South African deployed equipment for the project.  Funds are requested for the following pieces of equipment:

{\bf Materials and Supplies:}  Funds are requested for ... 

{\bf Indirect Costs:}
The rate of 56.5\% is used to determine the estimated Indirect Cost. The total indirect cost is calculated using the modified total direct cost base (which excludes equipment, graduate student tuition and fees). This reflects the On-Campus Organized Research Facilities and Administrative Cost Rate established by the institution and DHHS in an agreement dated 27 July 2007.

{\bf Indirect Costs:}
Indirect cost is calculated at the University's federally negotiated rate for on-campus research at 56.5\% of MTDC from July 1, 2013 through June 30, 2015.  The rate increases to 57.0\% starting July 1, 2015.  Modified Total Direct Cost (MTDC) excludes equipment, capital expenditures, and charges for patient care, tuition remission, rent, scholarships, fellowships, and subcontracts except for the first \$25,000.

\section{University of Pennsylvania}

The University of Pennsylvania (Penn) group will host the central computing cluster and data archive for HERA.  Penn currently performs this function for PAPER.  The cluster will be maintained by an IT professional.  Penn will also ensure that data flows smoothly from South Africa to the central storage, and thence to collaborators as necessary.

In addition, building on our experience with the PAPER data compression in South Africa, we will provide the quality assurance (QA) of raw data, including both software and hardware checking and reporting on the data in real time.  This will be the responsibility of the postdoctoral fellow and the graduate student, with the goal of making science quality data available by early in year 2.  

Finally, we we continue our investigation of polarization effects on the reionization power spectrum, providing feedback on the performance of the antenna design, providing polarization calibration, and pioneering polarization leakage mitigation techniques as necessary.  This, combined with power spectrum analysis, will form the basis for a graduate student thesis.

\noindent {\bf PI} One month of summer salary per year is requested for the
co-PI at the standard rate for 5 years.\\

\noindent {\bf IT Professional} Ten percent of an IT professional is requested for 5 years, to maintain the computing and storage cluster at Penn.  This level of commitment is consistent with the experience gained with the PAPER cluster.\\

\noindent {\bf Postdoctoral Fellow} A postdoctoral fellow is requested for the first two years of the grant to lead the implementation of the data verification and quality assurance pipeline, which is an outgrowth of the PAPER compression and data monitoring system.  This will allow data from the HERA-37 array to be rapidly brought to science quality.\\ 

\noindent {\bf Graduate Student} Graduate student support is requested for
one student over the 5 year life of the project.  The graduate student will work on the data QA software and commissioning, and will continue the investigation of polarization effects of the HERA antennas.  The time period is sufficiently long to bring the student to complete thesis from construction and commissioning to science based on HERA data.  \\

\noindent {\bf Travel} Domestic travel is included to allow for collaboration meetings and coordination of data reduction efforts between institutions.  While videoconferencing and internet exchange will be actively pursued, our experience with PAPER and MWA suggests that an in-person ``busy week'' is an extremely effective method of rapidly moving data analysis forward.  Foreign travel is budgeted to allow multiple multi-person visits the South African telescope site and to scientific collaborators, for similar reasons.\\

\noindent {\bf Publication page charges} Because HERA will be generating data from day 1 based on the existing PAPER infrastructure, we expect to be able to generate science papers even in the first year of the grant.  The budget includes one modest length paper per year.

\noindent {\bf Shipping} We have budgeted for shipping both the QA Cluster (see below), with 25\% shipping in year 1, and the remainder in year 3.  In addition, in the later years of the project, it may become necessary to physically ship data via tape or disk, and we have allowed for this possibility to bring data back to the US.

\noindent {\bf Quality Assurance Computing Cluster}  Subsequent to the initial data taking, and running in parallel to the compression process, the data will be subject to a series of tests determining data health and quality.  We expect that this will take approximately an 8 node cluster.  The budget allows for 2 nodes in the first year for prototyping of the software.  This is the same size as the current PAPER cluster, and working on an identical data rate.  The remainder of the cluster will be built in year 3 to handle the increased data volume.

\noindent {\bf Main US Computing and Storage Cluster} The central storage and main computing cluster for PAPER has been maintained at Penn, currently consisting of 22 compute nodes and $\sim$140 TB of fast-access, RAIDed storage.  We have extrapolated the data rate to HERA-568, allowing for compression, and have budgeted for approximately 2 PB of storage to hold compressed versions of multiple seasons of data at Penn for subsequent data analysis on the computing cluster, or for distributions of subsets to collaborators.  Based on extrapolations from the PAPER data reduction, and allowing for Moore's Law, we expect that a 32-node computing cluster will be adequate for reducing the HERA-568 data.  The budget reflects purchasing both the larger cluster and the bulk of the storage in years 3 and 4 to take maximum advantage of increases in computing power and disk capacity.

{\bf Indirect Costs:}
Common cost recovery on salaries, fringe benefits, travel, materials, and servies are charged at the standard rate.
